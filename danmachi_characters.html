<h2>Liliruca Arde</h2>
<p>Lili 
originally hated adventurers due to the treatment she received as a supporter, using that as an excuse to trick and steal from adventurers she partied with. She also treated Bell the same way, however, his actions repeatedly caused her to question her own attitude. After she is saved by Bell, she becomes much closer to him and develops romantic feelings for him.

Lili often uses her experience to gather information or do jobs that Bell and the other members of the Hestia Familia would be unable to do properly. She is also frequently amazed at how Bell seems to constantly get himself involved in trouble, yet she still cooperates with him in whatever he does.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

<h2>Sanjouno Haruhime</h2>
<p>is a gentle, timid, well-mannered, and extremely kind girl. She is respectful of everyone she meets and is eager to help when given the chance.

<h2>Wiene</h2>
<p>
has amber eyes and long silver blue hair with scales in several places on her body. She also has a red stone in the center of her forehead called Vouivre's Tear that is worth a great fortune when sold in the market.

Wiene wore the Salamander Wool, that Bell gave her in order to hide her identity as a monster, during her stay in the Hestia Familia.

When Wiene saved a young boy her body grew a wing from her back. The wing was big enough to cover half of her body even when folded.
