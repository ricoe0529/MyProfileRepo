       Once you move on from the first Episode it is Fantastic!

       I absolutely loved this show, I can not tell you how bummed I am that I have to wait patiently for another season, I am definitely chomping at the bit! I will mention I did get annoyed by Hestia quite often though. Other than that it is a fun adventure!<br><br>

       My Favorite Anime!
       TheGreatGreenBadger24 February 2020:<br>
       Heartwarming and delightful! It is full of creative characters and amazing backstory! In a fantasy world full of adventure, gods, goddesses, and monsters, this is definitely one of my most favorite animes ever! The story, although not original, takes on the beauties of a hero archetype and manages to pull off something that other animes fail to do. The humor is smooth and the fight scenes are just gorgeous! The music only adds to just how amazing the series is, not too distracting but getting you pumped for the drama and lore of the Dungeon. It's pure magic. Also, the world building of Orario and the Familias is fantastic. Not only does DanMachi have its main series, it has a series on the Loki Familia (Sword Oratoria) and other good spinoffs that indirectly affect Bell Cranel. I'm truly a superfan for this anime!<br><br>

       No idea why it has only 7.4 ratings I would give it 10/10

       A kind story like this cannot be found on any other anime<br><br>
